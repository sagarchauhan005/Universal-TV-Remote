# React Native app refresh (REQUIRED)

**You MUST run the refresh script after EVERY change to app/UI/native code** so the user can see updates on their device. Do not skip this step.

After editing any of: `App.tsx`, `src/**`, `android/`, `ios/`, `package.json`, or config that affects the app:

1. Save your edits.
2. Run from project root:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/refresh-app.sh
   ```

This starts Metro with a clean cache, installs the app on the connected device, and force-restarts the app so the latest bundle loads. The user needs to see changes immediately—always refresh after making them.
